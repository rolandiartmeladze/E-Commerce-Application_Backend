# Full Stack E-Commerce Application - Backend

Welcome to the backend repository of my full stack e-commerce application! This Node.js Express app handles requests from the frontend, interacts with the database, and prepares responses to be sent back to the client.

## Overview

This application serves as the backbone of the e-commerce platform, managing user authentication, product management, inventory tracking, and other essential functionalities. It's built with **Node.js** and **Express**, providing a robust and scalable server-side environment.

## Features

- **RESTful API**: Define RESTful endpoints to handle CRUD operations for users, products, orders, etc.
- **Database Integration**: Interact with **MongoDB** using **Mongoose** to store and retrieve data.
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Implement user authentication and authorization to control access to protected endpoints.
- **Middleware**: Utilize middleware functions for request preprocessing, error handling, logging, etc.
- **Security**: Implement security measures such as input validation, encryption, and rate limiting to protect against common web vulnerabilities.
- **Scalability**: Design the application with scalability in mind to accommodate growing user bases and increasing traffic.
